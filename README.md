The NetworkDNS project is an high-performance, event-driven DNS client and server. 

- Note: There is a maximum packet size for UDP, 508 bytes *to guarantee it's unfragmented*

- This is for cross-platform use, specifically - linux 32/64, mac 32/64, and windows 32/64. Java 8+
    - Please note that Java6 runtimes have issues with their classloader loading classes recursively (you will get a StackOverflow exception). We have taken precautions to mitigate this, but be aware that it is a very real possibility. We recommend using Java7+ to prevent this issue.
